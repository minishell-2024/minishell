# 🐚 Minishell

**🔍 Dive into the Fundamentals of Shell Programming**

Minishell is a simplified 🐧 Unix shell, implemented in C, designed for 🎓 students to deepen their understanding of command-line operations and shell development. It emphasizes core Unix principles, providing hands-on experience in building a functional shell.

## ✨ Features
- **🖥️ Interactive Command Prompt**: Execute commands like in a typical shell.
- **🔑 Built-in Commands**: Includes essential commands such as `echo`, `cd`, `pwd`, `export`, `unset`, `env`, and `exit`.
- **🔄 Redirection & Piping**: Manage input/output with redirections (`<`, `>` `>>`, `<<`) and pipe commands (`|`).
- **🌿 Environment Variable Handling**: Define, modify, and use environment variables effectively.
- **⚠️ Signal Handling**: Properly handle signals like `ctrl-C` (interrupt), `ctrl-D` (EOF), and `ctrl-\`.
- **🕰️ Command History**: Access and reuse previously executed commands.

## ❓ Why Minishell?
Minishell provides a practical way for 🎓 students to learn the mechanics of a 🐧 Unix shell. It covers essential concepts such as ⚙️ process management, 🗂️ file descriptor handling, ⚠️ signal management, and 📝 user input parsing. These are fundamental topics in understanding system-level programming. This project gives students the opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge in a 🌍 real-world scenario, solidifying their understanding of C and Unix programming.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To get started with Minishell, clone the 📂 repository and compile the code using the following commands:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:minishell-2024/minishell.git
cd minishell
make
./minishell
```

## 📜 Project Background
Minishell is part of the **42 School** curriculum, focusing on reimplementing essential features of Unix-like shells to build proficiency in **system programming** and the **C language**. The project encourages 🎓 students to learn by doing, gaining a deep understanding of every layer of shell functionality.

Contributions are encouraged to further improve Minishell or expand its features.
